This code integrates face recognition, OpenCV, and Arduino to build a face-detection system that triggers a light when a known face is identified. The program starts by capturing images from a webcam using OpenCV. It then utilizes the face_recognition library to compare the live feed with a set of known images stored in a specified directory. When a match is found, it sends a signal to an Arduino microcontroller, which in turn triggers the LED to turn ON. If the detected face is not found in the stored images or no face is detected, the LED remains OFF. The solution leverages Python's powerful libraries and the interoperability of Python with Arduino to create a simple, interactive face-detection system.
